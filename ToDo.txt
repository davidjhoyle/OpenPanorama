•	Move all landscape processing into a dedicated set of sources away from the rest
•	Draw into a bitmap that I manage rather than using the slow drawing primitives
•	Separate OS spot heights into spot height text additions and spot height landscape drawing
•	Add support for very large LIDAR files - support for Why Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF? https://www.cogeo.org/

Downloading LiDAR data

There are several options for the downloading of LiDAR data.

The URL links for the Historic LiDAR Archive tiles and the Welsh Government 2020-2022 dataset tiles are available in the feature information pop up panel that appears when clicking on the map when the Historic LiDAR Archive or Welsh Government 2020-2022 tile index layer visibility is turned on.

Alternatively, the How to download LiDAR data guide explains how to use the raster data plug in to download available Historic LiDAR Archive data.

Links to the DTM and DSM datasets 32 bit, 16 bit and hillshade Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) are listed below. Please note that these are very large files and that downloading the full data can take an extremely long time and a large amount of storage. The COG links can, however, be copied and pasted into GIS such as QGIS as a raster layer. Read more about COGs

Fix Label Text Additions

Add JPG quality parameter = jPGQuality
Renumber all specials so they don't conflict with others...

LIDAR Enforced Max Range - don't allow it to drop
LIDAR - remember max view distance from previous render and use this as the max distance.

Fix Stellarium ZIP transparent floor bug

Add extra Peak Declination value - work out the declination for the peak for the location.
Sin d = (sin l x sin h) + (cos l x cos h x cos az)
Where d = declination, l = latitude, h = horizon height and az = azimuth
Adjust the declination for refraction

Update the Peak processing to handle north properly.


Update to read the horizon data from the CSV file.
